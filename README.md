Developers can easily build a packaged any-grid.js using bower, NPM and gulp.

First install or update your local project's **npm** tools:

```bash
# First install all the NPM tools:
npm install

# Or update
npm update
```

Then install bower dependencies

```bash
# install dependencies to bower_components folder
bower install
```

Then run the **gulp** task:

```bash
# To build `any-grid.js in the `/dist` directory
gulp build
```

#### Bower

For developers not interested in building the Any Grid library... use **bower** to install
and use the Any Grid distribution files.

Change to your project's root directory.

```bash
# To get the latest stable version, use Bower from the command line.
bower install any-grid
```
